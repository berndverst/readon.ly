Hi, I'm Bernd, a [developer advocate](https://developer.microsoft.com/advocates) on the Azure engineering team at Microsoft.

At Microsoft my focus areas include anything related to Python (but not data science / machine learning), containers and Linux.


Did you know the federal government operates a **Kubernetes** cluster and open-source **Cloud Foundry** in the public cloud to make government more efficient? Before joining Microsoft I worked for the **United States Government** ([18F](https://18f.gov) / [General Services Administration](https://gsa.gov)) on **cloud.gov** enabling government dev teams to ship web apps the modern way. My experience truly spans a variety of cloud providers and technologies:


- At [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) I focussed on **App Engine**, helped a then tiny startup (now well-known mobile app) called Snapchat with application architecture, and worked on the launch of **Google Compute Engine**.
- At [Twitter](https://ads.twitter.com) I learned anything and everything about ad tech and deployed production apps to **Apache Mesos**.
- At several startups in Silicon Valley, such as [Sift Science](https://siftscience.com) (YCombinator Summer '11), I used a variety of **AWS** services.


Outside of work I enjoy running (training for 3 marathons this summer), playing jazz piano, studying Chinese Mandarin, and engaging in a variety of outdoor activities. I'm passionate about mentoring students and those early in their careers to help them land their feet in the tech industry.
