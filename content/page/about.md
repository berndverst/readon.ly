My name is Bernd Verst. I am a `developer advocate` on the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) team.

I focus on the `Python` developer community. Other things I dabble with include DevOps, Java, Scala, Android and iOS (Swift).

Some of my past teams:

- [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov) at [18F](https://18f.gov), a Heroku-like PaaS for the federal government.
- The [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) team, where I worked primarily on App Engine, Big Query and CloudSQL.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com), where I was a developer advocate for the Fabric Mobile SDKs and the Ad Platform.
